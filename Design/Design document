2nd level. The character reconstructs their personality. The character has to talk to 4 NPCs to pass the level. 
1 NPC: “What is your temperament?”
•	Sanguine. I always see the bright side of things. Among friends, I’m usually the one to keep the conversation going. I often have brilliant ideas on how to spend my free time. 
•	Choleric. I find it hard to be patient and compromising and lose my temper often. I have big aspirations for my career, and my friends call me ambitious. 
•	Melancholic. I’m always dissatisfied with my personality and society, which is why my friends describe me as a perfectionist. I might spend hours on self-reflections. I avoid asking people for help, prefer to rely on my skills and abilities. 
•	Phlegmatic. I tend to conceal my emotions from my family and friends. Whenever possible, I avoid conflicts. I don’t mind routine tasks.
2 NPC: “Your former co-worker, Bob, with whom you hadn’t kept in touch for 5 years, showed up and asked to let him stay at your place for several weeks. At that time, it was highly inconvenient for you to have a guest because you had prepared to upgrade your house. What did you do?”
•	I postponed my plans and agreed to help. 
•	I said, “Sorry, I can’t help you.”
3 NPC: “Do you remember any occasion when you lost self-control?”
•	Many times. Once I binge-watched series and went to sleep far after midnight. As a result, I was late for work the next day and was unproductive. I even got an administrative warning from my boss.
•	No way! I don’t remember having any problems with following my schedule. I always set specific goals for each day and accomplish them. I’m always productive.
4 NPC: “Your co-worker, Jane, was feeling low one week because she broke up with her partner. She asked you to go to a cafe with her and listen to her story. Did you agree?”
•	Of course. I thought Jane might return me the favour one day.

Important features:
•	Combat. There are three types of enemies that first appear on the second level. The types of enemies:
o	Low self-esteem presented as a character with a blush 
o	Depression presented as a character with a sad face
o	Phobia presented as a character with an expression of fear on their face
o	Panic attacks presented as a character with a face similar to a scream emoji
Each job allows the character to fight against one type of enemies. Other enemies should be avoided on the second level. The job of a psychologist allows to fight against low self-esteem. The job of a musician allows to fight against depression. The job of a math teacher allows to fight against phobia. The job of a yoga instructor allows to fight against panic attacks. 
After a player chooses a type of temperament on the second level, the character either gains the ability to fight another type of enemies or becomes stronger in fighting the type of enemies they can fight based on their chosen job.
o	Sanguine can fight against depression
o	Choleric can fight against low self-esteem 
o	Melancholic can fight against phobia
o	Phlegmatic can fight against panic attacks
If a player chooses their character to be a psychologist and choleric, then the character will be able to fight against one type of enemies. Yet, the strength of attacks will increase. 
If a player chooses their character to be a psychologist and sanguine, then the character will be able to fight both low self-esteem and depression. 
•	Sanity system. There is a sanity system that appears on the second level. Sanity is influenced by conversations with evil NPCs. After a sanity decreasing conversation, the character has to find a cure by collecting specific objects. Chosen hobby determines what objects a character can collect to restore sanity when sanity level decreases. 
o	If the chosen hobby is drawing, then the character can collect paintbrushes and easels. The protagonist's sanity increases after he/she has collected three paintbrushes and one easel.
o	If the chosen hobby is playing chess, then the character has to collect 3 pawns and 1 chessboard to restore sanity.
