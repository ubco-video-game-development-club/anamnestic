# Game progression

## 1st level
The game starts with the protagonist crossing a bridge and entering the void walking space. After wandering for some time through the changing landscape, the protagonist comes across the spirit guide. 
#### The NPC gives instructions, “Take a deep breath and tell me what you see.”
#### The player has four options of an answer: 
1.	I’m in a skiff that swings in the sea waves. My eyes are paining because I’ve been staring at the fishing floats for hours. I’m wearing shabby clothes. I guess I’m a poor fisherman from a small town. 
2.	I’m in a poorly furnished room with an old wooden bed. I’m sweeping the floor with a besom. I remember that a lodger stayed here for the night. He left the inn in the early morning. I suppose I’m an innkeeper. 
3.	I’m trudging, driving a team of horses to plough the soil of my farmland. The plough is old and has a wooden frame. My clothes are drenched in sweat. I’m feeling extremely thirsty. My muscles are tense. I think I’m a farmer. 
4.	I’m in a shop stocked with merchandise. I see all sorts of clothes which I’d call old-fashioned now. I’m sitting at the table. I’m calculating numbers and writing them into a tattered notebook with yellowish pages. I believe I’m a merchant.

After choosing an option, the player continues walking. 
#### During the second encounter with the spirit guide, the NPC says, “Tell me what’s happening.” 
#### Based on the previously chosen option, the protagonist automatically gives one of the following answers:
1.	Fisherman’s answer. The more ruthlessly the sun burns my shoulders, the harder I grit my teeth. As I close my eyes in delirium, I shed tears at my loneliness and dream about wealth. Suddenly, I hear something hit the boat with a thump. I lean forward and pick up a bottle with a folded paper inside. I open the bottle, unwrap the moldy paper, and discover a pirate treasure map.
2.	Innkeeper’s answer. I shovel dust, spider webs, and dead moths from under the bed. I’m like a moth trapped in the web of duties with no one to support me. Unexpectedly the next move of my besom uncovers a rolled paper. Intrigued, I pick it up and soon find out that it’s a pirate treasure map. 
3.	Farmer’s answer. I make a stop to rest and turn around to look at my ramshackle house. Nobody is waiting for me there. How great it’d be to at least have some riches! The blinding sun brings tears to my eyes, and, avoiding the unbearable light, I look down. Something is glittering in the crease left by the plough. I kneel and start digging with my hands. When I realize that it’s a small chest, I forget about my exhaustion and run to the house to get a shovel. Soon I open the chest and find a pirate treasure map inside.
4.	Merchant’s answer. I’m feeling sad. My life passes by in loneliness, in conversations with numbers that signify my revenue and that are always small. A customer wearing a black hood approaches me. The stranger says, “I’m buying these clothes from you. Here is my payment. It’ll be more than enough.” I leap up. I’m furious. “Come back, thief! You have to pay!” I chase the stranger, but as I run out of my shop, I only see a faceless crowd. I come back to my table and look at the paper that the stranger left. It’s a pirate treasure map.
The 1st level ends after 2 meetings with the spirit guide.

## 2nd level
The protagonist continues wandering. During five meetings with the spirit guide, the protagonist collects memories about an unsuccessful attempt to uncover the treasure. After this failure, the protagonist returns home to assemble a team.

## 3rd level
#### During the first encounter, the spirit guide says, “What’s going on?”
#### The protagonist answers, “I make a decision that I won’t share the treasure with the crew because I was the one to find the map. I know four people whom I might ask for help. Yet, the fewer people know about the treasure, the better. So, I’ll pick two members for my team.”

The protagonist continues wandering. 
#### During the second meeting, the spirit guide says, “What team members do you choose?”
#### The player must choose two out of four individuals for the team. 
1.	Jim 
2.	John
3.	Solveig
4.	Ingrid

The third meeting:
#### The spirit guide, “What do you do afterward?”
#### The protagonist, “We meet in my shack. I collect everyone’s savings, which is enough to buy the necessary equipment (ropes, anchors, hammers, a cart) and rent a yacht for one month in the sea. We go to the port and choose a yacht with a diesel power plant for our voyage.”

The character moves to the 4th level. 

## 4th level
The protagonist wanders through the void space and comes across the spirit guide. The story is told in 5 memories. It describes the voyage to the island where the treasure is buried. 

## 5th level
The story describes the adventures on the island and the discovery of the chest with treasures. 

## 6th level
The story is about how the team transports the chest to the shore. 

## 7th level
The first encounter with the spirit guide. 
#### The spirit guide, “Tell me what’s going on.”
#### The protagonist, “Exhausted after the long travel through the cave, my teammates and I lie down on the shore. My comrades soon fall asleep. I sit up and look at the chest with treasures. I am not sure what to do…”
The second encounter with the spirit guide. 
#### The spirit guide, “What’s on your mind?”
#### The protagonist, “Well, I’m torn between four possible actions.” The player can choose what to do next. 
1)	“The hardships of our journey made me treat my teammates as my friends. I want to divide the treasures equally between us even though I won’t have a second chance to better my life if I misuse my share. I look forward to radically changing my life and keeping my newly built relationships.” 
2)	“I go with my initial plan. I stand up, glance one last time at my sleeping teammates, and start pulling the chest to the yacht. Meanwhile, the following thoughts visit me. I won’t come back to my hometown. I’ll steal the yacht and sail to some far-away foreign city where I’ll build my new house and live in luxury and solitude for the rest of my days. As I load the chest on the yacht, I tell myself, ‘You’re doing everything right. The treasure is yours.’”
3)	“Lying on the sand and staring at the blue sky above, I realize that I am not ready for the changes. I want to come back to my old shack and spend my days in comfort. I don’t want to shake every night in my bed, leaping to my feet at every noise that sounds like a burglar breaking into my house. I don’t want to have high expectations of luxurious life and then wake up one day to find them ruined. So, I drag the chest to the yacht. Then I sail far away from the shore and push the chest into the depths of the sea.”
4)	Looking at my sleeping teammates, I come to realize that they will make better use of the treasures. I’ll most likely waste my fortune in gambling, lose my house and job. After my teammates wake up, I generously thank them for their help and tell them that they can keep the treasures.

The character moves to the next level.

## 8th level
The character crosses the bridge. 
#### The first encounter is with the spirit guide. The spirit guide, “Let’s discuss your experience.”
#### The protagonist: 
#### If the first ending was chosen, the character has these options:
1)	Building good relationships could be the meaning of my life.
2)	I don’t think I discovered the meaning of my life, but I definitely learned to value and reward any help I receive. 
3)	The session was rather useless. I didn’t discover anything new about myself. I’m open to taking risks to improve my life. Moreover, I never deceive people. 
4)	I don’t think I discovered the meaning of my life, but I learned that it’s important to take risks to better my life. 
5)	I don’t think this story can teach me anything. The therapy session was useless. I want my money back!
#### If the second ending was chosen, the character has these options:
1)	Gaining wealth and living in luxury is the meaning of my life.
2)	I didn’t find the meaning of my life, but I learned to pursue my happiness at all costs. 
3)	I didn’t find the meaning of my life, but I realized I shouldn’t have left my teammates without their shares.
4)	I haven’t discovered anything about my personality. The session was a waste of time and money.
#### If the third ending was chosen, the character has these options:
1)	I realized I’m content with my life and don’t seek changes. Perhaps, the meaning of my life is doing my job well.
2)	I didn’t find the meaning of my life. Yet, I might be prone to making choices for other people without asking their opinion.
3)	Maybe, the meaning of my life is having a piece of mind.
4)	I’m a perfectionist. I believe that society will be better off if everyone gains their wealth through honest labour.
5)	I don’t think this story can teach me anything. The therapy session was useless. I want my money back!
#### If the fourth ending was chosen, the character has these options:
1)	The meaning of my life is altruism. 
2)	The session didn’t help me to achieve my goal. But, I guess, I should never dream about gaining a fortune through pure luck.
3)	The session didn’t help me to achieve my goal. The only thing I learned about myself is that I should probably improve my self-esteem.
4)	Maybe, I’m pessimistic.
5)	Perhaps, I shouldn’t have given away the treasures. I regret this decision now.
6)	I don’t think this story can teach me anything. The therapy session was useless. I want my money back!

The second encounter is with the skeptic. 
#### The skeptic, “Do you notice any anachronisms or misconceptions in your story?”
#### The character answers, “Alright, I’m still not sure what century I’ve just visited. It seems to be the early 1900-s. I am not sure if you could actually rent a yacht back then. I’m also confused about what country I lived in. Also, perhaps, pirate treasure maps are a misconception. And the lessons I’ve just discussed with my spirit guide are rather cliché.”

The third encounter is with the skeptic. 
#### The skeptic, “So, do you believe in your past life?”
#### The character can choose what to say:
1)	Stop bothering me with your skepticism! I enjoyed the adventure. I don’t care if it was real or just a fantasy. 
2)	Well, I guess, it was all made up.
3)	I prefer to believe I just saw my past life.
4)	Come on! I can’t give a definite answer. It might be real or made up. I’ll have another past life regression to make up my mind.
The game ends.

-	Depression presented as a character with a sad face
-	Phobia presented as a character with an expression of fear on their face

If a player chooses their character to be a psychologist and choleric, then the character will be able to fight against one type of enemies. Yet, the strength of attacks will increase. 

If a player chooses their character to be a psychologist and sanguine, then the character will be able to fight both low self-esteem and depression. 

## Sanity system
